    It is process of retrieval of data from multiple tables simulations is known as joints.


# Why and when we used joint.
    ==> when every attribute to be selected from both the tables we use joins.

# Types of joints .
1) Cartisian join (Cross Join) .
2) Inner join (EQUI JOIN).
3) Outer join 
            I] Left outer join.
            II] Right outer join.
            III] Full outer join.
4) self join.
5) natural join.



#1) Cartisian join (Cross Join) 
        ==> in Cartesian join (Cross Join) table one record  ........  all the record of table two.

 Synatax : ANSI 
            SELECT COL_NAME 
            FROM TABLE_NAME1 CROSS JOIN TABLE_NAME2;

 Synatax: ORACLE
            SELECT COL_NAME 
            FROM TABLE_NAME1,TABLE_NAME2;


 #) Drawback: no matching record.



#2] Inner JOIN (EQUI JOIN) :
    ==> it is only obtained matching records which have provided
